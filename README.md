I created this project to enable an external hardware console to control an SDR (Software Defined Radio) application via a CAT (Computer Aided Transceiver) interface. 
With this external hardware, I can remotely control the frequency, volume, squelch, and modes of the SDR application. 
I am currently using SDRUno as the SDR software, but there are other applications with CAT interface capability that can also be used.

This is the external hardware CAT controll Console.
